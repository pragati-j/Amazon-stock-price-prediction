# Amazon-stock-price-prediction
In this project, a time series forecasting system was engineered to predict Amazon stock prices. This involved extensive data cleaning and the visualization of significant market trends.

The project's core involved the development of an LSTM-based model, utilizing historical data from the prior 60 days.
Furthermore, the project demonstrated the model's superiority over the conventional ARIMA model. Specifically, the LSTM model excelled in capturing and forecasting daily price fluctuations, an area where the ARIMA model struggled to perform effectively. This underscores the LSTM model's potential for precise and dependable stock price forecasting
