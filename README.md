# Amazon-stock-price-prediction
In this project, a time series forecasting system was engineered to predict Amazon stock prices. This involved extensive data cleaning and the visualization of significant market trends.

The core of the project involved the development of an LSTM-based model, utilizing historical data from the prior 60 days. This model achieved impressive results, boasting a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) loss of 86 and an L1 loss of 48, illustrating its exceptional predictive performance.

Furthermore, the project demonstrated the model's superiority over the conventional ARIMA model. Specifically, the LSTM model excelled in capturing and forecasting daily price fluctuations, an area where the ARIMA model struggled to perform effectively. This underscores the LSTM model's potential for precise and dependable stock price forecasting
